# Portfolio of Wiley Jones
This is my portfolio for programming, web dev, etc.

If you're here regarding the MechSe Student Map:
I've created this as a fun way to develop my programming skills. If you have suggestions on how to best improve it please reach out to me at wjones700@gmail.com. It's simply a visual way to keep track of what some of the other MechSe students are up to, potentially helping you connect with people at various companies or in a specific location. It also allows us to brag on ourselves! We're cool!

Head on over to the Google Form and fill out your information so I can get you on here. Since I'm a sub-par dev, it's very manaul and won't update instantly.
